# Leo vs. Communauto: MontrÃ©al Car Sharing Price Analysis & Visualization

This repository contains the analysis and visualization tools used to compare the pricing structures of two popular car-sharing services in MontrÃ©al, QuÃ©bec: Leo Autopartage and Communauto. The goal is to help users understand potential costs for various trip scenarios and identify which service might be more economical based on their usage patterns.

This project includes:
*   A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) for generating comparative graphs and performing scenario analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

Car sharing offers a flexible alternative to car ownership, but navigating different pricing models can be challenging. This project aims to demystify the costs associated with Leo and Communauto by:

1.  **Modeling Pricing Rules:** Accurately implementing the publicly available fee schedules, including hourly rates, daily maximums, kilometer charges, subscription fees, special rates (like Long Distance or Workday), and per-trip fees.
2.  **Simulating Trip Scenarios:** Calculating estimated costs for a wide range of typical urban trips (short errands, commutes, day trips) and longer excursions.
3.  **Visualizing Comparisons:** Generating clear graphs (bar charts, line plots, heatmaps) to illustrate cost differences across various Communauto plans versus Leo for specific use cases.
4.  **Providing Insights:** Helping users identify which service or specific Communauto plan might be more cost-effective for their individual needs.
